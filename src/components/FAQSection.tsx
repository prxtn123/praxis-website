    question: "How quickly can NodeHub be installed on new sites?",
    answer: "Most sites are live within 2-4 weeks from contract signature, including network readiness audit and pilot tuning."
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need to replace existing cameras?",
    answer: "No. NodeHub supports standard RTSP/ONVIF cameras and can also work with new high-res cameras for the highest fidelity risk detection."
  },
  {
    question: "What data residency guarantees do you provide?",
    answer: "All video processing is on-prem. Metadata and incident logs are retained in your specified region (UK/EU/US) and we provide a DPA with SCCs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can NodeHub integrate with our current MES/WMS?",
    answer: "Yes. We support connectors for SAP EWM, Oracle WMS, Blue Yonder, and custom webhook/Kafka integrations."
